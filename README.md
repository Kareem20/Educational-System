# Educational Management System

Console java project as a practice of concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).

**About project** 

This project is a simple educational system (such as Acadox).
it links between Students and Doctors.
I use dummy data in a project.


**In the section of Doctors:**
- Each doctor has a username, password, e-mail, and other information. 
- Doctor can create a course 
- Doctor can add assignments for a specific course.
- In the main menu, the Doctor can know:
   - List of available courses in the system.
   - List of his teaching courses.
   - View a specific course and all its details (name, code, number of registered students,..etc).
   - View the solution of assignment of a specific course and set grade for the student (this feature still in the building).
